# elderberry

A custom Discord bot intended to carry on the functionality of [lolbot](https://github.com/lolbot-project/lolbot) at a smaller scale. It uses the [hikari](https://hikari-py.github.io) library (with the help of [lightbulb](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb)) to do so.

# Motivation

My IRL friends actually like using lolbot's features - I want to keep a subset of its features at least available for use in our server (since I have decided to sunset the bot). Combine that with way too much free time and you get `elderberry`. Woo.
